    """
    Unpacks a packed histogram file into 8 separate histogram files.
    
    The packed file is expected to be 21504 bytes long (1024 bins Ã— 21 bytes per bin)
    where each 21-byte block contains eight 21-bit counts (one per histogram) stored
    consecutively (little-endian). This function extracts each 21-bit count and saves
    each histogram as a binary file with 1024 32-bit unsigned integers.
    
    Parameters:
        packed_filename (str): Path to the packed file (e.g., "histograms.pack").
